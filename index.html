									This paper investigates the effect of firms' debt maturity composition on their product pricing behaviors. To empirically examine this, we construct a novel micro-level dataset that links product prices with data on manufacturers' debt maturity schedules. By leveraging both a quasi-exogenous credit supply shock and a monetary policy shock, we show that firms with higher short-term debt ratios increase product prices more substantially when refinancing of maturing debt becomes more costly and refinancing options are limited. Our findings suggest that firms respond to refinancing challenges by strategically raising prices to mitigate rollover risk. To rationalize these results, we develop a dynamic firm model where firms issue both short- and long-term debt to finance operations in the face of negative cash-flow shocks. In our model, firms set prices strategically, which in turn affects the accumulation of customer capital. The results indicate that under increased debt repayment pressure and unfavorable refinancing conditions, firms raise product prices to mitigate rollover risk, even at the cost of losing future customers. Overall, our findings underscore the critical role of debt maturity profiles in shaping firms' product pricing decisions.									"

									data-es="Using data on the near universe of US job vacancies, this paper studies the impact of the opioid crisis on employers' job skill requirements. Specifically, we investigate the effect of the reformulation of OxyContin, which represents one of the most substantial reductions in the availability of abusable prescription opioids. This reformulation resulted in a large transition from prescription opioids to more dangerous illicit opioids. Using a difference-in-differences event study design that exploits firm-level variation in exposure to reformulation, we show that this transition toward illicit opioids has reduced employment at the firm level. Furthermore, we find that firms have increased requirements for cognitive and computer skills in response to this crisis. Finally, we find that the reformulation has resulted in reductions in local store sales, firm revenue, and firm capital stock, highlighting how the opioid crisis may impact firms' hiring decisions by affecting various aspects of the firm's constraints and considerations."

									data-es="The opioid crisis in the United States has reached unprecedented levels, but little is known about the role of pharmacists. Using large-scale data from pharmacists' online job profiles linked with data on opioid dispensing at the pharmacies where they work after graduation, we investigate how the financial burden of pharmacy education influences their career choices and subsequent dispensing behaviors. We compare opioid dispensing quantities across pharmacists working in the same county but trained at institutions with different tuition costs. First, we show that pharmacies dispensing more opioids tend to provide higher wages. Second, we find that even among pharmacies in the same county, pharmacists from higher-tuition institutions are more likely to work at pharmacies with higher opioid dispensing. Lastly, we demonstrate that the positive association between pharmacy education costs and opioid dispensing is stronger among pharmacists who are in their first two years post-graduation, male pharmacists, and those working in areas with more severe prescription opioid use. Our findings suggest that pharmacists from institutions with higher tuition, who likely face greater student debt, may be more inclined to work at pharmacies that dispense larger quantities of opioids due to financial concerns."

									data-es="While growing evidence indicates that the opioid crisis has led to a reduction in local labor supply, whether this decline can be attributable to worker flow in and out of the local area remains unclear. Using over 130 million online job profiles of workers in the US, this paper investigates the effect of the opioid crisis on workers' location choices. Our job profile data capture worker-level job transitions from 2007 to 2019, allowing us to measure the inflow and outflow of workers for every county pair. We use a difference-in-differences design that leverages geographic variation in exposure to the 2010 reformulation of OxyContin, which led to a large transition from prescription opioids to illicit opioids. We find strong evidence that this transition toward illicit opioids resulted in an increased net outflow of workers away from counties more affected by the reformulation relative to those less affected. Moreover, we show that the increase in net outflow is more pronounced among higher-skilled workers, leading to a substantial decrease in the average skill level of the workers in highly exposed areas. Finally, we investigate the economic consequences of the net outflow among high-skilled workers and demonstrate that the reformulation is associated with a decline in local innovation in terms of patent filings and startup formation. Overall, our findings suggest that the opioid crisis adversely affects both the quantity and quality of local labor supply by influencing workers' location choices, eventually leading to a deterioration in the economic prospects of affected areas."

However, little is known about the role of credit supply shocks in explaining these declines. This study investigates whether and to what extent negative credit supply shocks decrease fertility rates. We construct county-level credit supply shocks using variation in year-to-year changes in loans for small businesses and home mortgages. Using these exogenous shocks derived from Bartik (1991)'s shift-share measure, we find that negative credit supply shocks decrease fertility rates both in the short and long run. Counties experienced an average-sized credit reduction in 2009 have had a long-term decrease in fertility rates by 3.17% between 2009–2019. Our heterogeneity analysis reveals that Whites and those aged under 30 decrease their fertility the most in response to negative credit shocks.

For example, we use detailed product descriptions of web-scraping data to calculate the market share of identified products, and we use these shares as weights to more precisely estimate the inflation rate. Our approaches may have important implications, as they will allow us to more accurately predict the inflation rate in a daily frequency  and ease  the comparisons of price indices across different countries."

									👋 ¡Hola a todos! A mis 25 años puedo afirmar rotúndamente que soy un apasionado de la informática y la enseñanza. He estado inmerso en el fascinante mundo de la tecnología desde que era un niño y desde entonces, he recorrido un largo camino académico y profesional.<br><br> Mi viaje comenzó con un Grado Superior en Desarrollo Web, seguido de un Grado en Ingeniería Informática en la UCAM, y luego un Máster en Nuevas Tecnologías en Informática en la Universidad de Murcia.<br><br> Actualmente, estoy trabajando en mi doctorado, mientras tengo el privilegio de dar clases en la Universidad de Murcia.
								</div>
							</div>
							<div>
								En mi experiencia docente, he encontrado que cada estudiante es único y merece un <span class="underline">enfoque de enseñanza personalizado</span> que se ajuste a sus propias necesidades y ritmo de aprendizaje. Por ello, mi objetivo principal es brindar una enseñanza de calidad y adaptada a cada uno de mis alumnos, con posibilidad de <span class="underline">enseñanza en Inglés y Castellano</span>. Estos son algunos de mis enfoques de enseñanza:
								<br><br>
								<ol>
									<li><b>Apoyo constante</b>: Estoy disponible para resolver dudas o proporcionar ayuda adicional cuando sea necesario. Creo que la comunicación abierta y regular es clave para un aprendizaje efectivo. 📞</li>
									<li><b>Herramientas innovadoras</b>: Utilizo herramientas de última generación para facilitar el aprendizaje y hacer que incluso los conceptos más complejos sean comprensibles. Uso de tabletas para ilustrar ideas, software colaborativo para trabajar en tiempo real, o proporcionar materiales de estudio personalizados. 💻📚</li>
									<li><b>Paciencia y comprensión</b>: Entiendo que todos aprendemos a nuestro propio ritmo. Por lo tanto, mi enfoque es siempre paciente y alentador, asegurándome de que cada concepto se comprenda completamente antes de pasar al siguiente. 🤗</li>
								</ol>
							</div>
						</div>

						<h4 class="particular-clickable">💼 <span class="particular-h4" data-es="Experiencia previa" data-en="Previous experience"></span></h4>
						<div>
							<p>
								Siempre he sido un apasionado de la informática. Mi historia con los ordenadores y la programación comenzó desde muy pequeño pero se puso en serio cuando me lancé a estudiar un <span class="underline">Grado Superior</span> de Desarrollo Web. No solo me encantó, sino que obtuve unas notas estupendas. Esto me abrió las puertas a una beca Erasmus+ para hacer prácticas en el extranjero. ¡Y sí, resulta que además de hablar informática, también hablo inglés bastante bien! 😂
								<br><br>

								Después de aquella experiencia, me sumergí en el <span class="underline">Grado en Ingeniería Informática</span> en la Universidad Católica San Antonio de Murcia (UCAM). Fueron años intensos y fascinantes en los que me llevé la sorpresa de mi vida al terminar con una media de 9.3 y, para mi asombro, ¡recibir el premio al mejor expediente de mi promoción! 🤯 (+26 matrículas de honor).
								<br><br>
								
								Pero mi amor por la informática y la curiosidad por seguir aprendiendo no conocían límites, así que me lancé a por un <span class="underline">Máster en Nuevas Tecnologías en Informática</span> en la Universidad de Murcia. Durante este tiempo, tuve la suerte de trabajar codo con codo con el Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC) en mi Trabajo de Fin de Máster, que acabó con una calificación de 9.9. Durante esos años, también tuve la oportunidad de compartir mi pasión por la informática a través de dos artículos que publiqué en congresos nacionales.
								<br><br>
								
								Hoy, gracias a una beca de la prestigiosa Fundación Séneca (¡y estoy muy orgulloso de ser uno de los cuatro seleccionados en toda la región!), estoy metido de lleno en mis <span class="underline">estudios de doctorado</span>. Y para redondear esta aventura, también tengo la increíble oportunidad de dar clases en la Universidad de Murcia, donde este año soy el profesor encargado de las prácticas de la asignatura Arquitecturas Multinúcleo y de Propósito Específico (AMPE). ¡Así que aquí estoy, listo para compartir todo lo que he aprendido en mi camino!
							</p>
						</div>

						<h4 class="particular-clickable">🎓 <span class="particular-h4" data-es="Especializaciones y cursos" data-en="Specializations and courses"></span></h4>
						<div>
							<p>
								Con mi amplia formación y experiencia, puedo ayudar a estudiantes de todas las edades y niveles, desde la primaria hasta la universidad. Aquí tienes una idea de las áreas en las que me especializo:

								<ol>
									<li><b>Informática básica</b>: Desde cómo utilizar un ordenador, navegación por internet, hasta seguridad informática básica, puedo ayudar a los más jóvenes a familiarizarse y desenvolverse en el mundo digital. 🖥️</li>
									<li><b>Programación y desarrollo web</b>: ¿Estás interesado en aprender a programar o a crear tu propia página web? Puedo enseñar desde los fundamentos de la programación hasta los lenguajes más avanzados, y orientar en el diseño y desarrollo de sitios web. 💻🌐</li>
									<li><b>Asignaturas universitarias de informática</b>: Si estás cursando un Grado o Máster en Informática y necesitas ayuda extra, puedo ofrecer soporte en asignaturas de computación, arquitectura, sistemas operativos, entre otras. 🎓🔬</li>
									<li><b>Inglés Técnico</b>: Gracias a mi experiencia estudiando y trabajando en el extranjero, puedo ayudarte a mejorar tu inglés técnico y académico, una habilidad esencial en el mundo de la informática y la tecnología. 🌍🗣️</li>
								</ol>

								Mi enfoque es siempre adaptar las lecciones a las necesidades específicas de cada estudiante. Así que <span class="underline">si tienes una solicitud especial, no dudes en comunicarte conmigo</span>, estaré encantado de atender tus necesidades o las de tu hijo. 🤝
							</p>
						</div>

						<h4 class="particular-clickable">📚 <span class="particular-h4" data-es="Material didáctico" data-en="Educational materials"></span></h4>
						<div>
							<p>
								Una de las cosas que realmente diferencia mis clases de las de otras academias o profesores particulares es el enfoque práctico y colaborativo que utilizo. Para asegurarme de que mis alumnos realmente comprendan y apliquen lo que aprenden, hago uso de una variedad de herramientas didácticas y tecnológicas:
								
								<ol>
									<li><b>Tableta e iPad</b>: Utilizo mi tableta y iPad para dibujar y explicar conceptos en tiempo real durante las clases. Esto significa que tendrás una explicación visual clara de lo que estoy enseñando, lo que facilitará la comprensión y retención. 🎨📱</li>
									<li><b>Programas de dibujo</b>: Domino una serie de programas de dibujo que me permiten ilustrar ideas y conceptos de una manera fácil de entender. Así, los alumnos pueden visualizar exactamente lo que estamos discutiendo y cómo se aplica. 🖌️💡</li>
									<li><b>Herramientas colaborativas</b>: Utilizo herramientas como Miro y Draw.io, que permiten a los alumnos participar y colaborar en tiempo real. Esto significa que no solo verán lo que hago, sino que también tendrán la oportunidad de participar proactivamente y aprender haciendo. 🔄🎲</li>
								</ol>

								El uso de estas herramientas modernas y colaborativas permite a los alumnos experimentar un aprendizaje interactivo y atractivo que no solo los ayudará a entender los conceptos, sino que también les dará las habilidades prácticas que necesitarán en el mundo real.
								<br><br>
								¡El objetivo siempre es proporcionar una enseñanza de la más alta calidad y hacer del aprendizaje una experiencia agradable y valiosa! 🌟🚀
							</p>
						</div>

						<h4 class="particular-clickable">💰 <span class="particular-h4" data-es="Precio hora" data-en="Price per hour"></span></h4>
						<div>
							<p>
								Entiendo que la calidad de la educación es una inversión importante para el futuro. Mi enfoque siempre ha sido proporcionar un servicio excepcional que supere las expectativas y justifique cada euro invertido.
								<br><br>

								El precio establecido es de <b>20 euros/hora</b>. Este precio refleja la calidad de la enseñanza que ofrezco, incluyendo mi amplia experiencia, mi enfoque personalizado y la utilización de herramientas de aprendizaje interactivas y modernas.
